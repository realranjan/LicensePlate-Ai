# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for organizing the License Plate Recognition System project. The current project structure is disorganized with files scattered throughout a single directory, making it difficult to maintain, understand, and extend. The system includes multiple interfaces (Tkinter GUI, Django web app, Jupyter notebook) and YOLOv5 machine learning components that need proper organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is organized THEN the system SHALL have separate directories for different components (web app, desktop app, ML models, data)
2. WHEN viewing the project structure THEN each directory SHALL contain only files relevant to that component
3. WHEN a new developer joins THEN they SHALL be able to understand the project structure within 5 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns, so that I can work on specific components without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on the web interface THEN the system SHALL isolate Django-related files in a dedicated directory
2. WHEN working on the desktop GUI THEN the system SHALL isolate Tkinter-related files in a dedicated directory
3. WHEN working on ML models THEN the system SHALL isolate YOLOv5 and training files in a dedicated directory
4. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL have separate directories for different types of data (images, models, outputs)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file naming and organization, so that I can quickly locate specific files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are organized THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions across all directories
2. WHEN looking for configuration files THEN they SHALL be grouped in appropriate locations
3. WHEN looking for utility scripts THEN they SHALL be clearly separated from main application files
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN requirements files SHALL be properly organized and documented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper documentation structure, so that I can understand how to use and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is organized THEN the system SHALL have a clear README file explaining the project structure
2. WHEN documentation exists THEN it SHALL be organized in a dedicated directory
3. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL be in a separate examples directory
4. WHEN setup instructions exist THEN they SHALL be easily accessible from the root directory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation of development and production files, so that I can maintain different environments effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL separate development notebooks from production code
2. WHEN managing outputs THEN temporary files and results SHALL be in designated output directories
3. WHEN handling test data THEN it SHALL be separated from production data
4. WHEN managing configuration THEN development and production configs SHALL be clearly distinguished
